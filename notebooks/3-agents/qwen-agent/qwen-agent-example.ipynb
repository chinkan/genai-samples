    "# Qwen-Agent Self-Writing and Self-Validating Python Program Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the capabilities of [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com.mcas.ms/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent), an AI-powered tool that can write and validate Python programs autonomously. In this demonstration, we'll showcase how Qwen-Agent can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand complex programming tasks\n",
    "2. Generate Python code to solve these tasks\n",
    "3. Validate the generated code for correctness\n",
    "4. Iteratively improve the code if necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "This powerful functionality allows developers to automate parts of the coding process, potentially saving time and reducing errors in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this demo, we'll use Ollama with the Qwen 2.5 7B model. Here's how to set it up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Ollama: Follow the instructions at [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.com/).\n",
    "2. Pull the Qwen 2.5 7B model:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ollama pull qwen2.5:7b\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Install the required Python packages:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install qwen-agent[code_interpreter,python_executor]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is set up, we can proceed with the Qwen-Agent demonstration.\n"
