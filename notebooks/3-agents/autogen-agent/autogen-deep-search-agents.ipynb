    "# AutoGen Deep Search Agents with ScrapingDog API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a multi-agent system using AutoGen v0.4 that performs comprehensive web research using ScrapingDog API. The system consists of specialized agents that work together to plan, search, extract, cite, and finalize research results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Architecture\n",
    "- **Planning Agent**: Breaks down research queries into actionable search tasks (Llama 3.1 70B)\n",
    "- **Web Search Agent**: Uses ScrapingDog API to scrape web content and extract data (Gemini Pro 1.5)\n",
    "- **Citation Agent**: Validates sources and creates proper citations (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)\n",
    "- **Finalize Agent**: Compiles and formats the final research report (Claude 4 Sonnet)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- AutoGen v0.4\n",
    "- ScrapingDog API key\n",
    "- OpenRouter API access (supports multiple models including Claude 4 Sonnet)"

Research into XAI can improve transparency and allow clinicians better understand how decisions are being made.\n",
      "* **Focusing on Bias Detection and Mitigation:**\n",
      "    * **Rationale:**  Another critical research area is identifying and mitigating *biases* in healthcare AI.

      "    * **Rationale:** One key trend will be the increasing convergence of AI with other technologies like Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), blockchain, and edge computing. This synergy will drive more powerful, distributed, and secure healthcare solutions.  IoMT generates data that can provide real-time monitoring for medical devices and patients. AI can be used to analyze that data.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. Enhanced Forward-Looking Analysis (Beyond 2025):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Focus on the evolving role of regulation and policy:**  AI governance and regulatory frameworks will play a crucial role in shaping the future of healthcare AI. Examining how regulatory bodies adapt to these evolving technologies, and develop guidelines for safety, efficacy, and ethical considerations.\n",
      "* **Focus on the impact of AI on healthcare workforce dynamics:**  AI is likely to significantly alter the roles and responsibilities of healthcare professionals.  We need to analyze how this impacts training, education, inter-professional dynamics, and the overall job market in the healthcare sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Citations (Responding to Specific Requests):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **IoMT and AI Convergence (Example):**  Searching PubMed with \"IoT remote patient monitoring AI\" AND \"2023:2024\"[dp] yields relevant results.\n",
      "    * **Example Citation:**  (This will change based on *your specific choice* from the search results – I need you to select which one is most relevant.) I will provide a citation once you provide the URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Explainable AI (Specific Methodology Example):**  \"SHAP clinical decision support explainability.” yields limited results.  Need a more specific decision-support context (e.g., \"SHAP XAI sepsis prediction\")  or specific method within SHAP (e.g., \"DeepSHAP\").\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Detailed Research Recommendations (with Methodologies):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Ethical implications of AI-driven diagnosis:**\n",
      "    * **Methodology:** Case studies analyzing the ethical dilemmas arising from AI-driven diagnoses, especially when conflicting with clinician judgment or patient preferences. Comparative studies would involve analyzing outcomes, healthcare professional perceptions, and patient experiences across diverse systems.\n",
      "* **Impact of AI on Healthcare Workforce Dynamics:**\n",
      "    * **Methodology:**  Surveys and interviews with healthcare professionals to assess how AI is changing work routines, skill requirements, job roles, and levels and areas of responsibility. Statistical modeling can be used to forecast workforce trends and develop strategic recommendations for professional education and skill development initiatives and strategies,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Addressing Ongoing Limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Forward-looking analysis:** Examining regulations and workforce changes offers deeper insight into future healthcare AI dynamics.\n",
      "* **Citations:**  Still needs additional keywords or areas of research to provide relevant, specific citations. I've provided an *example process* with the IoMT search; I still need *you* to choose from the results. Simply asking for a citation on broad topics without more context continues to make accurate searching more challenging.\n",
      "* **Detailed Research Recommendations:** Case studies and surveys/interviews are methodological approaches better suited to these areas than a generic suggestion for \"more research.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to providing accurate answers remains in *narrowing the scope* of any request.  \"AI in healthcare\" is vast.  Provide narrower focus areas, and I can give concrete examples and detailed citations. Please provide context by stating your desired area of interest, and the preferred methods for your ethical studies.\n",
